        Dimensionality reduction techniques such as **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis) and **t-SNE** help simplify high-dimensional datasets like MNIST, which contains images of handwritten digits.

        In this report, we explore:
        1. **PCA** for variance analysis and reconstruction.
        2. **t-SNE** for non-linear visualization.
        3. The trade-off between **information loss** and **computational efficiency**.
        4. The effectiveness of these methods for **image data analysis**.

        ### Key Takeaways:
        1. **PCA** effectively reduces dimensionality while retaining most of the variance, making it suitable for linear patterns and reconstructions.
        2. **t-SNE** preserves local relationships, providing clearer visualizations of clusters in complex, non-linear data.
        3. **Trade-Off**:
           - Reducing dimensions improves computational efficiency.
           - However, fewer dimensions may lead to some **information loss**.
        4. Dimensionality reduction is a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional image data.

        Overall, these techniques simplify data without significantly compromising its structure, enabling better insights and efficiency.
